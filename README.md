# Optimizing-Revenue-Leakages-and-Profitability-in-the-Hospitality-Sector
This project was built as part of an academic initiative under IIT Guwahati. The goal was to explore how data analytics can be used to identify and reduce revenue leakages while improving profitability in the hospitality sector using hotel booking data.

Objective
To analyze booking behavior, cancellations, revenue patterns, and customer trends to offer actionable business insights for the hospitality industry.

Tools Used
Python (Google Colab)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook (via Google Colab)

Project Structure
exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb — Full data analysis notebook with visualizations

data/ — Contains the dataset used for analysis

outputs/ — Charts and CSVs generated from the notebook

Key Insights
High cancellation rates were identified in city hotels and during specific seasons

Repeated guests were more likely to complete bookings

Longer stays tended to generate more revenue but were also more likely to cancel if not prepaid

Distribution channels and lead times significantly affected booking patterns

How to Run
Open exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb in Google Colab

Upload the dataset (provided in data folder)
